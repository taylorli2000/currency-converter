# Chat App

This is a currency conversion web app. You can use it to see how much one currency is valued against another currency.
I built this app to learn more about fetching data from an API and displaying formatted data on the page.

## Installing / Getting started


```shell
git clone git@github.com:taylorli2000/currency-converter.git
cd currency-converter
npm install
npm start
```

### Initial Configuration

To run the web app, clone the repo and install the dependancies, then start the app by running the script npm start.
